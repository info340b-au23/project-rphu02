                <p> Our first interactive component is an interactive map of <br>
                    the University of Washington Campus that allows us to see where each study spot is located upon <br>
                    clicking on each study spot, it will display short important information on a pop-up
                    message about this study spot like hours-open, popularity, etc </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Our second interactive component is going to be some type of filtering system, <br>
                    this will allow users to filter out study spots based on their preferences like noise <br>
                    level, size of study group, locations (N, E, W, S), and other options, this will either <br>
                    be done through a check box system or a drop menu with different options for users to select. <br>
                    Note that this filtering system will either be on a separate page like how dubs <br>
                    dumps did where upon clicking different options it will narrow down the different <br>
                    images of the study spots or we will have these filtering systems on the same 
                    page on the page where the filtering will be applied directly to the map. <br>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Our last interactive component is going to be some type of blog system where <br>
                    users will be in a textbox that will allow users to input their opinions/ thoughts and <br>
                    whatever they feel about. This will be similar to Reddit where users can type <br>
                    things and it will display. This will allow users of our websites to get opinions <br>
                    from other UW students about where their favorite places are to study or what they <br>
                    don't like or like about a certain location.
