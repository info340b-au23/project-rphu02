            <h2>What is U StudySpots?</h2>    
        </header>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Our idea for this project is to make a website that will help users find study spots around the 
                    University Of Washington. This will be helpful because the UW campus is very big and new students, 
                    especially freshman and incoming students, may not know where to go. The weather in Washington also changes frequently, 
                    which means a good place to study during the summer may not be a good place to study during the winter. 
                    Along with this, each student has their own preference surrounding their study environment and nothing
                    is worse than constantly moving to different building because your current location doesn't fit your study preferences. </p>

            <h2>The Issue</h2>
        </header>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>There is not really a website dedicated to helping find study spots. The main problem is that a lot of websites like
                    reddits and forums are all personal preferences but everyone preferences are different so they might not as helpful. 
                    Additionally, some of the <a href="https://qr.ae/pKNwVy">answers</a> online also provide old information that may no longer be applicable to students today. 
                    On top of that, sometimes posts don't include important information like hours of the buildings and some people 
                    may have busy schedules that need to be considered. Another problem with reddit is that they lack photos and directions
                    so unless you remember the building location off the top of your head you might not know where it is.</p>

            <h2>Existing Solutions</h2>
        </header>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>One existing solution that exists are online forums, specifically sites like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/14dht8/best_places_to_study/">Reddit</a>. These help give good study 
                         spots around the UW campus because it allows students that have attended or students who are currently 
                         attending UW to give their opinions so they are reliable and authentic. These sites are good because they have a
                         reply feature that allows users to post positive and cons about an certain location. The only problem
                         is that everyones preferences are different so comments might not work for everyone. Finally, it is possible
                        that data within these forums are not up to date, since people's comments are just a snapshot in the time that they were left. </p>

        </header>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> Students of The University Of Washington will primarily be accessing the website, This <br>
                    website might have a positive impact on minority groups, especially if students of <br>
                    minority groups are shy or afraid to reach out to other students, this will be a good <br>
                    website for them to use if they are trying to find a place to study that fit their preference <br>
                    without talking to other people.

            <h2>Interactive Features of our website</h2>
        </header>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> Our first interactive component is an interactive map of the University <br>
                    of Washington Campus that allows us to see where each study spot is located upon <br>
                    clicking on each study spot, it will display short important information on a pop-up <br>
                    message about this study spot like hours-open, popularity, etc 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Our second interactive component is going to be some type of filtering system, <br>
                    this will allow users to filter out study spots based on their preferences like noise <br>
                    level, size of study group, locations (N, E, W, S), and other options, this will either <br>
                    be done through a check box system or a drop menu with different options for users to select. <br>
                    Note that this filtering system will either be on a separate page like how dubs <br>
                    dumps did where upon clicking different options it will narrow down the different <br>
                    images of the study spots or we will have these filtering systems on the same <br>
                    page on the page where the filtering will be applied directly to the map.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Our last interactive component is going to be some type of blog system where <br>
                    users will be in a textbox that will allow users to input their opinions/ thoughts and <br>
                    whatever they feel about. This will be similar to Reddit where users can type <br>
                    things and it will display. This will allow users of our websites to get opinions <br>
                    from other UW students about where their favorite places are to study or what they <br>
                    don't like or like about a certain location.

                <p>
                    Our site is providing users with detailed information about all the study spots on campus. <br>
                    To do so, we will need the following information:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Building names</li>
                        <li>Building locations</li>
                        <li>Building hours</li>
                        <li>Accessibility (major restricted, open to the pubic, appointments and etc)</li>
                        <li>Environment of the building (loud, quiet, crowdedness and etc)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    In order to show key points and to provide an easily interactable map, we may use the <a href="https://mapsplatform.google.com/">Google Maps API</a>.
                    This API would help us create a customizable map of UW where we can flag study spots, and provide searchable building names.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Our website will help with this problem because it is a combination of every available <br>
                    source in one convenient location. It includes the blog feature like reddit that allows <br>
                    users to get opinions from other students and it also allows students to find study spots <br>
                    that fit directly to their preferences which is one of the main problems that websites <br>
                    like reddit have. Along with this, including images and visuals will help users determine <br>
                    if a spot is fit for them which is something that reddit does not really use. Finally, students <br>
                    would be able to directly navigate to these study spots through the interactive map.
