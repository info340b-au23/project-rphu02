            <h2>What is U StudySpots?</h2>    
        </header>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Our idea for this project is to make a website that will help users find study spots around the <br>
                    University Of Washington. This will be helpful because the UW campus is very big and new students, <br>
                    especially freshman and incoming students, may not know where to go. The weather in Washington also changes frequently, <br>
                    which means a good place to study during the summer may not be a good place to study during the winter. <br>
                    Along with this, each student has their own preference surrounding their study environment and nothing <br>
                    is worse than constantly moving to different building because your current location doesn't fit your study preferences. </p>
            </li>

            <h2>The Issue</h2>
        </header>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>There is not really a website dedicated to helping find study spots. The main problem is that a lot of websites like <br>
                    reddits and forums are all personal preferences but everyone preferences are different so they might not as helpful. <br>
                    Additionally, some of the <a href="https://qr.ae/pKNwVy">answers</a> online also provide old information that may no longer be applicable to students today. <br>
                    On top of that, sometimes posts don't include important information like hours of the buildings and some people <br>
                    may have busy schedules that need to be considered. Another problem with reddit is that they lack photos and directions<br>
                    so unless you remember the building location off the top of your head you might not know where it is.</p>

            <h2>Existing Solutions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>One existing solution that exists are online forums, specifically sites like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/14dht8/best_places_to_study/">Reddit</a>. These help give good study <br>
                         spots around the UW campus because it allows students that have attended or students who are currently <br>
                         attending UW to give their opinions so they are reliable and authentic. These sites are good because they have a<br>
                         reply feature that allows users to post positive and cons about an certain location. The only problem<br>
                         is that everyones preferences are different so comments might not work for everyone. Finally, it is possible<br>
                        that data within these forums are not up to date, since people's comments are just a snapshot in the time that they were left. </p>

            <h2>Users of the website</h2>
        </header>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> Students of The University Of Washington will primarily be accessing the website, This <br>
                    website might have a positive impact on minority groups, especially if students of <br>
                    minority groups are shy or afraid to reach out to other students, this will be a good <br>
                    website for them to use if they are trying to find a place to study that fit their preference <br>
                    without talking to other people.

            <h2>Interactive Features of our website</h2>
        </header>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> Our first interactive component is an interactive map of the University <br>
                    of Washington Campus that allows us to see where each study spot is located upon <br>
                    clicking on each study spot, it will display short important information on a pop-up <br>
                    message about this study spot like hours-open, popularity, etc 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Our second interactive component is going to be some type of filtering system, <br>
                    this will allow users to filter out study spots based on their preferences like noise <br>
                    level, size of study group, locations (N, E, W, S), and other options, this will either <br>
                    be done through a check box system or a drop menu with different options for users to select. <br>
                    Note that this filtering system will either be on a separate page like how dubs <br>
                    dumps did where upon clicking different options it will narrow down the different <br>
                    images of the study spots or we will have these filtering systems on the same <br>
                    page on the page where the filtering will be applied directly to the map.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Our last interactive component is going to be some type of blog system where <br>
                    users will be in a textbox that will allow users to input their opinions/ thoughts and <br>
                    whatever they feel about. This will be similar to Reddit where users can type <br>
                    things and it will display. This will allow users of our websites to get opinions <br>
                    from other UW students about where their favorite places are to study or what they <br>
                    don't like or like about a certain location.
